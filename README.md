# CSE 475 Capstone Milestone 3 Deployment
This is a multiple part project that first included creating a Machine Learning Algorithm of our choice. This specific part is just a simple website to deploy the model and be able to interact with the algorithm.

The website will ask for a couple of inputs and predict whether a company will go bankrupt or not. Currently it has a precision of almost 80% with an accuracy of 97.8%. The results are not definitive but it is good at predicting whether a company will go bankrupt or not.

Currently it has not been adjusted for companies of different sizes that might have different thresholds so if you do happen to try it take the result with a grain of salt.
